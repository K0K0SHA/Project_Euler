# Project Euler Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even valued terms.

# Notes
* 4 mil is included in the calculation.
* The general solution is extremely simple. We just need a summation function that adds the sum to the running total if the sum is even, and a way to iterate the Fibonacci sequence
* For this, we need 4 variables: sum (which is a running total), a, b, and c. c is required because we need a placeholder for the value of a before we iterate
