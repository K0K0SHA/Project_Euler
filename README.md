# About Project Euler
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)  
Pronounced "Leonard Oiler"  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler  

## What is Project Euler?
  Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
  The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Who are the problems aimed at?
  The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.
  Currently we have 1368953 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220 locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve the problems.

## Can anyone solve the problems?
  The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work their way through the problems.

# PROJECT EULER APPLICATIONS (by K0K0$H@)
  Time spent solving Project Euler problems is not wasted. This is not college busywork, and it is not just abstract mathematical problems for the sake of mathematics. These programming challenges have practical applications. To me, the most obvious practical application is encryption. Every Euler problem I've seen can be used to create a custom encryption cipher. Mastery of the challenges, in other words not just solving the Euler challenge, but creating a program where the challenge is solved even if any and/or all variables in the challenge are varied, will result in the creation of an encryption algorithm. Perhaps that's the point of project Euler. Thus, mastery of each level involves creating a custom encryption cipher using the concepts learned in the level.
